#About RSH

Not to be confused with remote shell. R stands for Rohan. 

This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user
commands and then executes each command in a separate process. Two other implemented features are to run the child process in the background using `&` and the `history` command along with `!!` and `!3`
