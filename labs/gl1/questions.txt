1. Write a program  which when executed creates 3 processes out of which one is children and one is grandchild process? Print the process-id of each of the processes[5]

2. Write a program or shellscript which creates one child and waits until this child terminates. Child should prompt the user by printing "Shall I terminate?" on STDOUT. Once the user enters, YES, it should terminate. After child terminates, the parent prints "Process id <pid> is terminating" on STDOUT and after that it terminates. [10]

   #include<sys/types.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>
   #include <unistd.h>
   #include <string.h>
   
   int main(int argc, char *argv[]){
       pid_t pid;
      
       //Do a man fork on bash prompt
       //create child process, check pid returned by the fork to decide parent/child
       //Write appropriate printf. 

      return 0; 
      }

3. Write a program that emulates shell command "opendir" command. [5]
